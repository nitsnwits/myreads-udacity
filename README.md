This is a project from Udacity's React Nanodgree first phase of React fundamentals. It is a book management Single Page app which helps you organize books into three different categories, search for more books and add it to shelves.

This project was built on top of starter code provided by Udacity in the [Starter Project for MyReads](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)
